Welcome! You have arrived at Population Divided: An Admin Survey.

The purpose of this project is to try to figure out weather there is a causal relationship between the number of highest-level administrative divisons in a particular nation-state and other common nation statstics, such as total population, number of major ethnic groups, or sqaure area.  For this project, I have chosen three countries: Kenya, Thailand, and Argentina. The countries are all on different continents,  have different economies and all have a unqiue relationships to major ethnic groups. 

# Hypothesis 

Before I began working on this project, I proposed a hypothesis that the number of highest-level administrative divisions in a nation is directly scaleable to either the total population or the number of major ethnic groups. 

## Explaining Terms

Before we get into the data and case study countries I will be defining terms. In this project, "highest-level administrative divisions" refers to the largest administrative divisions in a nation that holds self-governing powers. For a country such as Kenya, with a somewhat devolved/decentralized government, this refers to the 47 counties. In regards to 'major ethnic groups', this project will define a major ethnic group as an ethnic group which consists of at least 2% of the total population of the nation I am examining.

## Project Process and Code 

I first began writing the code to this project via 

### Kenya

### Argentina

### Thailand

### A quick chart 

| Country      | Total Population  | Number of Major Ethnic Groups | Sqaure Area[km^2]   |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------------------------------|:--------------------|
| Kenya        | good swedish fish | nice                          |                     |
| Argentina    | good and plenty   | nice                          |                     |
| Thailand     | good `oreos`      | hmm                           |                     |
