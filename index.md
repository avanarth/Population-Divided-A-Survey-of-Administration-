Welcome! You have arrived at Population Divided: An Admin Survey.

[Link to another page](./another-page.html).

The purpose of this project is to try to figure out weather there is a causal relationship between the number of highest-level administrative divisons in a particular nation-state and other common nation statstics, such as total population, number of major ethnic groups, or sqaure area.  For this project, I have chosen three countries: Kenya, Thailand, and Argentina. The countries are all on different continents 

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Hypothesis 

Before I began working on this project, I proposed a hypothesis that the number of highest-level administrative divisions in a nation is directly scaleable to either the total population or the number of major ethnic groups. 

## Explaining Terms

Before we get into the data and case study countries I will be defining terms. In this project, "highest-level administrative divisions" refers to the largest administrative divisions in a nation that holds self-governing powers. For a country such as Kenya, with a somewhat devolved/decentralized government, this refers to the 47 counties.
